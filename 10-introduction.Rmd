# Introduction

The aim of pharmacokinetics (PK) studies is to examine the kinetics of a drug with regard to absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination in the body. 
PK data analysis consists of noncompartmental analysis (NCA) and nonlinear regression analysis. [@acharya;@gab] 
NCA uses the trapezoidal rule for measurement of area under the concentration-time curve (AUC), and requires fewer assumptions than model-based analysis. [@gab] 
NCA allows for estimation of various PK parameters such as AUC, peak observed drug concentration (C~max~), time of peak concentration (T~max~), and elimination half-life. 
Particularly, AUC and C~max~ are often accepted as the criteria for approval of bioequivalent drugs.

R, a widely-used computer language, is a suite of libraries of statistical and mathematical computations. [@R-base]
Despite its relatively small base system compared with other commercial softwares for NCA such as WinNonlinÂ®[4] and Kinetica,[5] R has robust functions for scientific computation and numerous add-in packages for use in various fields. [6] 
Therefore, many efforts are being made to replace commercial softwares with R packages.

In this article, we introduce two newly-developed R packages, NonCompart [@R-NonCompart] and ncar [@R-ncar], that are compatible with SDTM (Study Data Tabulation Model)-formatted dataset of CDISC (Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium), which is the standard of documentation submitted to regulatory authorities,[7] while providing a practical method for producing complete NCA reports.
