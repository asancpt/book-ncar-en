In this tutorial, we introduce a series of R packages, NonCompart, ncar, and pkr designed for noncompartmental analysis as closely as possible to the most widely used commercial software for pharmacokinetic analysis. We demonstrated how accurately the results of the commercial software were reproduced and how easily the results, report, and plots can be obtained by this R packages. "],

["methods.html", "Chapter 3 Methods 3.1 Softwares 3.2 Datasets", " Chapter 3 Methods 3.1 Softwares In this tutorial, we will use R 3.4.2 and it can be downloaded via CRAN (https://cran.r-project.com). WinNonlin® (Pharsight, Mountain View, CA, USA) under MS-Windows 7 (64 bit) was used for the comparison of calculated values. The R packages can be installed and loaded by the scripts below. install.packages(&#39;NonCompart&#39;, &#39;ncar&#39;, &#39;pkr&#39;) library(NonCompart) library(ncar) library(pkr) 3.2 Datasets R itself contains two pharmacokinetic datasets, called Theoph and Indometh. In this tutorial we will use these datasets. (Figure 6.3) In NCA R packages, the input dataset should be prepared as a long format as Theoph dataset shown in Table 3.1, and if a dataset is in a wide format, it can be easily converted using gather() function in tidyr package. Data preparation is one of the most important parts in accurate NCA process, therefore using trackable and reproducible code scripts like R, SAS, or python is highly recommended. Using R for data preparation and NCA together will significantly reduce time and efforts for performing NCA.

["examples.html", "Chapter 4 Examples 4.1 Calculation 4.2 Reports 4.3 Plots", " Chapter 4 Examples 4.1 Calculation A function tblNCA() of NonCompart package generates a simple table-format output of NCA with an attribute of units. tblNCA() contains several function arguments as shown below. tblNCA(concData, key = &quot;Subject&quot;, colTime = &quot;Time&quot;, colConc = &quot;conc&quot;, dose = 0, adm = &quot;Extravascular&quot;, dur = 0, doseUnit = &quot;mg&quot;, timeUnit = &quot;h&quot;, concUnit = &quot;ug/L&quot;, down = &quot;Linear&quot;, MW = 0) One can input several keys such as subject demographics, information regarding dose, period, or sequence and the result of tblNCA() will print the keys and the carried keys can be further used for additional statistical analysis (i.e. descriptive statistics, bioequivalence test, t-test or ANOVA). The adm argument can be ‘Extravascular’, ‘Bolus’, or ‘Infusion’. The down argument can be ‘Linear’ or ‘Log’. 4.2 Reports (Refer to Dr. Kim’s manuscript) 4.3 Plots plotPK() function generates multiple files.

["summary.html", "Chapter 5 Summary", " Chapter 5 Summary A comparison of NCA metrics obtained by the ncar package and WinNonlin showed no discrepancies. The ncar package is a fast, easy-to-use and versatile tool-set written in R programming language that successfully perform NCA with the concentration-time data. This R package produces a comprehensive set of graphical and tabular output to summarize the NCA results, which is a complete report in PDF or RTF format. We hope that our newly-developed packages enable researchers to perform reliable and accurate NCA using R. "],
